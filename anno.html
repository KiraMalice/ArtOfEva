    <p class="AnnoParagraph1">
      Hideaki Anno is a Japanese animator, film director, and screenwriter.
      <br />
      He was born on May 22, 1960, in Ube, Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan. Anno
      <br />
      is best known for creating the seminal anime series "Neon Genesis <br />
      Evangelion," which first aired in 1995 and has since become a cultural
      <br />
      phenomenon. The series was widely acclaimed for its complex themes, <br />
      characters, and innovative use of visual effects.
    </p>

    <p class="AnnoParagraph2">
      Anno started his career in the anime industry in the early 1980s, working
      <br />
      as an animator on several projects. He went on to become a key figure in
      the industry, and was instrumental in creating several influential anime
      series, including "Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water" and "Royal Space
      Force: The Wings of Honneamise." In 1995, Anno created "Neon Genesis
      Evangelion," which became one of the most popular and acclaimed anime
      series of all time. The series dealt with complex themes such as
      depression, the human psyche, and religious and philosophical ideas, and
      was known for its use of psychological and spiritual elements. Its impact
      on the anime industry was immense. After the success of "Neon Genesis
      Evangelion," Anno continued to work in the anime industry, directing and
      producing other anime series and films. He is widely regarded as one of
      the most talented and influential figures in the anime industry and has
      received critical acclaim for his work.

    <p class="AnnoParagraph3">
      Anno has famously said when asked by a student in an interesting
      "interview" like activity where he would be in a school, contributing to
      the children's curiculum, whether or not he "Liked the anime he made", to
      which he first responded, "Like.. Well I like some, but hate others". This
      was followed by the more famous dialouge of "What parts do you not like?",
      <br />
      to which he replied, <br />
      <em> "The parts where I see myself". </em>
      <br />
      The clip from the interview is shown below.
